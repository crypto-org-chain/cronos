# ADR 002: Use a custom fork of ibc-go

## Changelog
* 29-10-2021: Draft of the decision record
* 26-05-2022: Update decision record

## Context

In order to automatically convert IBC's vouchers originated from other chains to CRC20 tokens, a "hook" mechanism is needed in ibc-go, so that "custom" code could be triggered upon an IBC token transfer event. ICS30 middleware implementation (https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/app/ics-030-middleware) could be used to achieve our requirements, but it is still work in progress and is expected to be released in the next major upgrade (v2.x.x). 

## Decision

Cronos will be using for the time being a forked version of ibc-go which implements a "hook" mechanism upon "receive", "send" and "refund" transfer in ibc-go transfer app.
The forked version will contain minimal code change compared to the original version and should not break any existing functionality.

The forked will be removed once ICS30 middleware is implemented in ibc-go and sufficient testing has been done so that we can ensure a safe upgrade.

** Update **

Cronos#429 (https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/pull/429) bumps ibc-go dependency to v3.0.0 which include ICS30 middleware support.

Cronos#511(https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/pull/511) replaces the "hook" with a custom ICS30 middleware.
The middleware implementation override `OnRecvPacket`, `OnAcknowledgmentPacket`, and `OnTimeoutPacket` which add additional logic 
to the TransferApp to handle voucher conversion.


## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive
* Automatic token conversion provided for mainnet launch
* Minimum effort needed

### Negative
* Need to maintain a forked version of ibc-go "temporary"
* A need for a breaking change upgrade in the future
