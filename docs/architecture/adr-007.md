# ADR 007: Generic event formats for evm-hook actions

## Changelog
* 9-06-2021: Initial Draft

## Context

The current evm-hooks relies on event emitted from a smart contract to trigger specific actions upon contract execution.
The current way to define those events is not flexible: events are hardcoded, parameters fixed and correspond only to one specific action.

This can lead to potential issue in the long run when commands needs to be updated to add more parameters (ibc-go/ gravity bridge) or even if we need to implement more "actions". Since contracts are immutable, contract developers won't be able to have access to these functions after deploying their CRC20 contracts.

In this ADR, we define generic events format that can be use by smart contract developer to call any "action" upon successful contract execution. 

## Decision

We define 2 specifics events that smart contract can use to trigger specific action after contract execution.

```
# Trigger an action after contract execution
__CronosCall(string functionName, byte[]args)

# Trigger an action after contract execution that require moving asset from the smart contract "account"
__CronosCallAfterPayment(string functionName, address payer, uint amount, byte[]args)

```

- **functionName** corresponds to the equivalent hardcoded eventName such as `CronosSendToIBC` for the event `__CronosSendToIbc` or `CronosSendToChain` for the event `__CronosSendToChain`
- **payer** is the address which make the payment, usually equal to `msg.sender`
- **amount** corresponds to the `amount` that the payer has paid (either by burning or sending asset to the SC)
- **args** corresponds to the argument in order of the event removing the `sender` and `amount` from the parameters



An example of smart contract implementing those function

```
pragma solidity ^0.6.8;

import "ds-token/token.sol";

Contract Demo is DSToken {

 __CronosCallAfterPayment(string functionName, address sender, uint amount, byte[]args)
 
 // unsafe_burn burn tokens without user's approval and authentication, used internally
 function unsafe_burn(address addr, uint amount) internal {
     // Deduct user's balance without approval
     require(balanceOf[addr] >= amount, "ds-token-insufficient-balance");
     balanceOf[addr] = sub(balanceOf[addr], amount);
     totalSupply = sub(totalSupply, amount);
     emit Burn(addr, amount);
 }
 
 // send an "amount" of the contract token to recipient through IBC
 function send_to_ibc(byte[] recipient) public {
     unsafe_burn(msg.sender, amount);
     emit __CronosCallAfterPayment("CronosSendToIbc", msg.sender, amount, recipient);
 }

```


On the chain side, the events parameters are decoded and uses to call a specific actions. 

List of possible action (as of today)

- Actions : `CronosCancelSendToChain`
- Actions after Payment: `CronosSendToAccount`, `CronosSendToIbc`, `CronosSendCroToIbc`, `CronosSendToChain`

 
With this generic event format, it is possible to add and remove the parameters for those action in the future or even add new actions while "upgrading" the chain. Smart contract won't be force to migrate to a new contract to benefit those functionnalities.


## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

### Positive
- A more flexible way to trigger action after executing a smart contract.
- Possibility to remove or add parameters to existing actions (if we upgrade ibc-go or gravity module for example)
- Possibility to add new actions and make them available to smart contract developpers without redeploying contract

### Negative
- Might have some security concerns if those actions are not correctly "bounded" by a scope
- Not possible to restrict bundled features for smart contract developpers once they implement the generic events
