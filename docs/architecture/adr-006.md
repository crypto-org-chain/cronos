# ADR 006: Migrating CRC20 contract to CRC21 standard

## Changelog
* 2022-06-08: first draft

## Context

The CRC20 standard specifies a function `send_to_ethereum` that was added, at that time, in prevision of the gravity bridge support.
However due to a change of design, the event format emitted by this function requires some changes (additional parameters need to be specified such as msg.sender and chain_id).

In the effort to not change the CRC20 standard, we have defined a new CRC21 standard that specify two events (`__CronosSendToChain` and `__CronosCancelSendToChain`) allowing cross-chain transfer of CRC20 through the gravity bridge. (Link to CRC21)

However numerous Dapps have deployed their own tokens following CRC20 standard and need to migrate if they want to be able to bridge with Ethereum or other evm-compatible chain. 



## Decision

For the above problem, we propose two solutions:

- The first solution is a bytecode replacement of all CRC20 contract deployed to the CRC21 contract bytecode. In that case we can directly merge CRC21 and CRC20 to a single standard.
  
- The second solution is to do nothing on the chain-side. Dapps developers are able to use a contract wrapper to expose CRC21 functionalities to their CRC20 tokens. We can create some templates to help them on their migrations.

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

### Positive of solution #1

- Dapps developers won't have to do anything
- CRC20 and CRC21 merged to a single standard is more clean in the long term.

### Negative of solution #1

- Requires engineering effort and network upgrade to replace contract bytecode
- Some contract does not follow exactly the CRC20 standard and won't be able to be migrated automatically
- Integrity of the smart contract immutability being violated?

### Positive of solution #2

- It is up to the Dapps to do the migration if they want to support bridging
- Nothing to do on the chain-side

### Negative of solution #2

- Required efforts on the Dapps side to support bridging functionality
- A wrapped version of the CRC20 contract needs to be created and thus can create some confusions for the DEX.
